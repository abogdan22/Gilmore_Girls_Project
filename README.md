# Gilmore_Girls_Project

The popular American comedy-drama tv series, Gilmore Girls, is well-known for having longer than average scripts due to the fast dialogue of the two main characters, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a mother-daughter duo. Most hour-long tv show scripts average around 40-50 pages in length while Gilmore Girls averaged around 80 pages! I chose to analyze Gilmore Girls due to my domain knowledge on the subject and to uncover patterns in speech text with the potential for better results given a larger sized corpus compared to many tv shows.

The methods applied in this project included:

* Data collection: webscraping tv scripts
* Data cleaning/preprocessing: creating OHCO structure, tokenization, generalization character name references, extracting statistical and linguistic features (e.g., word frequency, probability, part of speech (POS), stop words), TFIDF, and creating two Bag-of-Words (BOWs) (e.g., episode and characters). 
* Initial Exploratory Analysis: word frequency count by characters and dispersion plots for main character food preferences/references
* Analysis/Methods: Word Embedding (Word2Vec), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Topic Models, Sentiment Analysis (by characters, seasons, and the entire show)

This was a super fun project especially applying these methods to a tv classic. I learned a lot and look forward to working on more NLP focused projects!
